# 1. Formulate and present the rationale for a hypothesis test that the researcher could use to compare the mean time spent on cell phones by male and female college students per week.
# 
#   Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the mean time spent on cell phones per week between male and female college students.
# 
#   Alternative hypothesis: The mean time spent on cell phones per week is different between male and female college students.
# 
# 2. Analyze the data to provide the hypothesis testing conclusion. What is the p-value for your test? What is your recommendation for the researcher?
# 
#   Since the p-value (0.76) is greater than the significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean time spent on cell phones per week is different between male and female college students.
# 
#   I would recommend that the researcher collect more data or conduct a different study with a larger sample size or a different design in order to get more conclusive results.
# 
#   With that said, there are also factors that should be taken into consideration. such as:
# 
#   I. Stratify the sample by gender: This would allow the researcher to compare the means of the two groups more accurately.
#   II. Use a different measure of time spent on cell phones: For example, the researcher could ask the students to track their cell phone usage for a week using a mobile app.
#   III. Control for other factors that might affect cell phone usage: These factors could include age, socioeconomic status, and academic major.
# 
# 3. Provided in the code
#
# 4. What is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of each gender category, and what is the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means of the two populations?
#   Confidence interval for mean (Gender 1): 9.80 9.84
#   Confidence interval for mean (Gender 2): 9.68 9.72
#   Confidence interval for mean difference: 0.10 0.14
#
# Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the mean time spent on phones for Males is between 9.80 and 9.84 hours, and for Females, it is between 9.68 and 9.72 hours. The 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means is between 0.10 and 0.14 hours, suggesting that the difference is likely to be within this range.
#
# 5. Do you see a need for larger sample sizes and more testing with the time spent on cell phones? Discuss.
#
# Based on the data and findings we have so far, there are a few reasons to believe that larger sample sizes and more testing with the time spent on cell phones could be beneficial:
#
# Inconclusive results: The p-value of 0.6 obtained in our analysis suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that we cannot definitively say whether there is a difference in the mean time spent on cell phones per week between male and female college students. More studies with larger samples would provide more conclusive results and help to clarify this relationship.
#
# 6. Make a report including the testing of the assumptions for two independent samples t-test.

# Report on Time Spent on Cell Phones by Gender
# Introduction:
#  This report investigates the relationship between gender and time spent on cell phones per week among college students. We analyze data from two separate groups: male and female students, and compare their average phone usage and test for potential differences.
#
# Data Description:
#   The data consists of time spent on cell phones per week (in hours) for two groups of college students: males and females. The sample sizes are n1 = 500 for males and n2 = 50 for females.
#
# Descriptive Statistics:
#
# As shown, male students have a slightly higher average time spent on phones (9.80 hours) compared to females (9.68 hours). However, the standard deviation is also slightly higher for males, indicating more variability in their phone usage.
#
#
#Testing Assumptions:
# 
# Before conducting the t-test, we need to ensure that the underlying assumptions are met:
#   
#   Independence: We assume that the time spent on phones by one student does not influence the time spent by another student, regardless of gender.
# Normality: We check if the time spent on phones within each gender group follows a normal distribution.
# Homoscedasticity: We verify that the variances of time spent on phones are equal for both genders.
# Normality:
#   
#   We can visually assess normality through histograms and QQ plots. However, for a more formal test, we can perform Shapiro-Wilk tests. Both tests indicate that the data for both genders is not normally distributed (p-values < 0.05).
# 
# Homoscedasticity:
#   
#   We can use Levene's test to assess homoscedasticity. In this case, the p-value is 0.189, suggesting that the variances are likely equal for both genders.
# 
# Addressing Non-Normality:
# 
# Since normality is not met, we can either:
# 
# Transform the data: Consider using transformations like square root or log to normalize the data.
# Use a non-parametric test: Opt for alternative tests like the Mann-Whitney U test that don't rely on normality assumptions.
# T-test Results:
#   
#   We proceed with the t-test assuming equal variances (Levene's test p > 0.05). The t-statistic is 0.30 with a p-value of 0.761. This indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in the average time spent on cell phones between male and female students at the 5% significance level.
# 
# Confidence Intervals:
# 
# We can also calculate 95% confidence intervals for the mean time spent on phones for each gender:
# 
# Male: (9.80, 9.84) hours
# Female: (9.68 9.72) hours
# These intervals suggest that the true population means for both genders likely fall within these ranges.
# 
# Limitations:
# 
# This study has limitations:
# 
# Sample size: Although substantial, the sample sizes might not be large enough to generalize the findings to the entire population of college students.
# Convenience sampling: The data might not be representative of all college students due to potential sampling bias.
# Self-reported data: Reliance on self-reported phone usage might introduce inaccuracies.

# Future Directions:
# 
#   Future researchers could:
# 
#     Include larger and more diverse samples.
#     Utilize objective measures like app tracking or network data for more accurate phone usage data.
#
# Conclusion:
# 
#   This study found no statistically significant difference in the average time spent on cell phones between male and female college students.
